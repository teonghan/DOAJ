# Database for Directory of Open Access Journal

Just a simple database on the list of Open Access Journal in the DOAJ website (https://doaj.org, accessible publicly) and the respective article processing charges (APCs)

All credits goes to DOAJ, I merely extract the data and presented in a CSV format. Let me know if I violate any terms of usage and I will be more that willing to take down the repo.
